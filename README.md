# 🚀 Road to Edge AI Expert: Professional DevLog

Welcome to my active learning laboratory. This repository is more than a collection of course notes; it is a **Proof of Work** journal documenting my transition into a specialist in **Edge AI and Deep Learning.**

### 🎯 The Mission

To bridge the gap between high-level Deep Learning theory and the practical constraints of Edge Hardware (latency, power, and memory). I am currently focused on mastering **PyTorch** and transitioning models to production-grade edge environments.

## 📓 The DevLog (Daily Progress)

_This section is updated daily (or 15 mins a day) to track consistency and troubleshooting._

### February 2026

- **Feb 14:** I build my first Neural Network with PyTorch, which consisted of a shallow neural network with single hidden layer and three neurons in the hidden layer.
  - _Insight:_ To allow the NN to learn non-linear patterns, the ReLU activation function was used. The NN was trained using MSE and SGD.
- **Feb 15:** Initialized roadmap. Started PyTorch Specialization. Setting up environmet for learning...
  - _Insight:_ Learned about how PyTorch uses tensors for efficient computation and basic tensor commands for reshape, tensor math, broadcasting, etc.
- **Feb 16:**
